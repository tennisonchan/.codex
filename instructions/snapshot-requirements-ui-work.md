## Snapshot Requirements (UI Work)
- Capture Playwright MCP screenshots for any UI-impacting change (before/after states as needed).
- Save under `/docs/screenshots/` with descriptive names (`feature-state.png`), or `/docs/tasks/` if evidencing a workflow.
- Reference snapshots in the PR description and task log; include which scenario each image represents.
- If animation is relevant, capture a short video/gif if tooling allows; otherwise note the motion in text.
