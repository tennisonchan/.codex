# Add Context in Knowledge Base

Capture tribal knowledge that would speed up future agents.

1) Evaluate impact: will this prevent rework or speed onboarding?
2) Write a markdown in `./docs/context/` with scenario, decisions, outcomes, and quick takeaways (actionable bullets first).
3) Link evidence (screenshots, timelines, tickets) nearby if useful.
4) Add a one-line summary + `@./docs/context/...` reference to AGENTS.md so it’s discoverable.
5) Commit/push with the task that generated it.
