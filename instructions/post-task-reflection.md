# Post-Task Reflection

Run this quick loop before you wrap any task:

1. Look back over the task log and your final steps: what blocked you, what sped you up, and any surprises.
2. Decide whether clearer guidance would prevent the same friction. If yes, update AGENTS.md and the relevant files under `instructions/` or `docs/context/` immediately (follow @./instructions/add-new-instruction.md or @./instructions/add-context-in-the-knowledge-base.md as needed).
3. If no changes are needed, still note that decision in your `docs/tasks/...` entry (e.g., "Reflection: no instruction updates").
4. When instructions were edited, commit and push them before closing the task (see @./instructions/submitting-github-prs.md).
