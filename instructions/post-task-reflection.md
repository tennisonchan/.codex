# Post-Task Reflection & Improvement

Run this loop before closing any task:

1) Review: skim your task log and final diff—what blocked you, what sped you up, any surprises.

2) Improve: decide if better guidance would prevent the friction. If yes, update AGENTS.md and relevant files in `instructions/` or `docs/context/` (see @./instructions/add-new-instruction.md and @./instructions/add-context-in-the-knowledge-base.md).

3) Record: note the reflection outcome in `docs/tasks/...` (e.g., “Reflection: updated instructions/context X/Y” or “no instruction changes”).

4) Ship docs: when instructions or context changed, commit and push them before closing the task.
