# Add New Instruction

After completing a long or complex task, decide whether the solution adds lasting value for future work:
- If it does, create a dedicated markdown file in `./instructions` that documents the new guidance or process in detail.
- Update `instructions.md` with a short summary of the instruction and reference the newly created file using the `@./instructions/...` syntax so other agents can discover it quickly.
