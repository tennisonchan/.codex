# Add New Instruction

Use this when a task produces reusable process guidance.

1) Decide if the lesson is repeatable and high-value.
2) Create a focused markdown in `./instructions/` with: purpose, when to use, steps, and examples/commands.
3) Link it from AGENTS.md (Task Instructions) with a one-line summary so future agents can find it.
4) Commit/push alongside related code or doc changes.
