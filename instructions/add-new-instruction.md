# Add New Instruction

After completing a long or complex task, decide whether the solution adds lasting value for future work:
- If it does, create a dedicated markdown file in `./instructions` that documents the new guidance or process in detail.
- Add a short summary and `@./instructions/...` reference in `AGENTS.md` under Task Instructions so other agents can discover it quickly.
