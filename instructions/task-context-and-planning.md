## Task Context & Planning

### Create the task log
- For any non-trivial task, start a file in `docs/tasks/{timestamp}-{short_description}.md`.
- Capture: goal, scope, assumptions, known risks, current Codex session id, and links to tickets/PRs.

### Keep it live
- Append notes as decisions happen (don’t wait until the end). Include who decided, what changed, and links to Slack/GitHub messages.
- Record blockers and the escalation you made (channel + time) if you ping Slack.

### Use the planning tool
- Make a multi-step plan for everything except the simplest ~25% of tasks.
- Plans must be actionable, ordered, and updated as you complete steps.

### Close the loop
- When finishing, note the outcome and the reflection result (“updated instructions X/Y” or “no instruction changes”).
- Link to any added docs in `instructions/` or `docs/context/` so future agents can find them.
