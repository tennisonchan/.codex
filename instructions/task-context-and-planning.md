## Task Context & Planning
- Every non-trivial task needs a context file in `docs/tasks/` following `{timestamp}-{short_description}.md`; record goals, assumptions, blockers, and the current Codex session id.
- Treat the context file as a living log—append notes as decisions happen rather than summarizing at the end.
- Use the built-in planning tool for most work (omit only for the simplest ≈25% of tasks). Plans must contain multiple actionable steps and be updated as progress is made.
- After the task, record your reflection outcome (instruction updates made or "no instruction changes") in the same log.
