# Scripts

- `create_tree.sh` — bootstrap a task worktree from a branch (copies env files, sets upstream, installs deps with pnpm).
- `setup-codex.sh` — load `.env.local` and render `config.toml` from `config.toml.tmpl`.

Add new scripts here with a one-line description and keep this list in sync with AGENTS.md.
