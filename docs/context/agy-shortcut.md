# agy Shortcut

- Run `agy <folder_name>` to open the specified worktree/folder in the Agy view.
- Use it when a request says "open it in agy"—pass the current worktree directory name (e.g., `agy true-10089-jest-no-identical-title`).
- Keep folder names exact to avoid opening the wrong target.
- Applies to CLI usage; no additional flags are needed.
