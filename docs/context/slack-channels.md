# Slack Channel Roles

- `engineering` (`C05GRNTBUDN`): Use for engineering discussions, PR review requests (include the PR link), or general technical collaboration threads.
- `escalations-dev` (`C06TFGKCT1A`): Customer Success escalation room; CS posts production bugs or incidents affecting `truewind-core`, and engineers coordinate fixes there.
- `tenn` (private DM / channel ID defined in `SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS`): Direct line to Tennison for decisions Codex agents cannot make alone; default destination for decision escalations described in @./instructions/slack-decision-prompts.md.

Refer back to this note whenever you need to choose a target for Slack MCP notifications.
